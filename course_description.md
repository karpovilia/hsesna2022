The course introduces students to the rapidly developing interdisciplinary field of study of structural data and patterns in them. As part of the course, we will consider methods for statistical and structural analysis of networks, models for the formation and evolution of networks and processes, machine learning on graphs. Particular attention will be paid to practical analysis and visualization of real networks using available software tools, modern programming languages and libraries.

As a result, students should:

Know:
- the basic principles behind the the existing social network models and concepts
- advantages of existing social network analysis packages

Be able to:
- get necessary data for research and applied projects 
- perform basic social network description
- use existing tools for network modelling
- criticize constructively and determine existing issues with applied SNA tasks 

Have:
- an understanding of the basic principles of contemporary social network analyses
- the skill to meaningfully develop an appropriate graph models
- the skill to visualize graph data

Basic knowledge of **python** programming language and statistics are required for this course.

## Grades
Course grade will be completed as follows:
[Final mark] = 0.4 * round([cumulative mark for the work during the modules]) + 0.6 * round( [mark for the final project]). 

### Evaluation of the work during the modules
The cumulative mark for the work during the modulus is based on the tests [cumulative mark for the work during the modules] = (test1 + test2 + test3 + test4 + test5 + test6)/6. If the student missed 5 classes or more, the final mark can be reduced by 25 %.

## Retaking the exam

The retake of the assessment for the final project is carried out for students who missed this element of control for a good reason. Retake is carried out before the end of the session. Peculiarities of retakes In case of receiving an unsatisfactory grade for the discipline, the student has an academic debt. The procedure for the first retake in the discipline is carried out on the basis of control and measuring materials (KIMs) for retakes, specially developed by the responsible teacher. The first retake is carried out in the form of an oral answer on tickets containing questions on the course and an oral defense of an individual project on the content of the entire course. The content of the questions in the tickets corresponds to the thematic content of the course: 1st question: topics 1-2 2nd question: topics 3-4 3rd question: topics 4-8. The project aims to assess competencies throughout the course. Requirements for the project are sent to the student by corporate e-mail no later than 8 days before the retake.

Evaluation formula for the first retake: *Result* = 0, 15 * *Question*1 + 0, 15 * *Question*2 + 0, 15 * *Question*3 + 0, 55 * *CP* The second transfer is not accepted by the commission less than three people. KIMs for the second retake are developed by the chairman of the commission. The procedure for the second retake and the thematic composition of KIMs are similar to the first retake. The retake is carried out in the presence of at least three members of the commission, including its chairman. The score is given at the end of the meeting. The score for the second retake is set by agreement of the members of the commission. In case of divergence of assessments, the decision is made by a majority of votes, in case of equality of votes, the assessment of the chairman of the commission is decisive. Blocking elements are not provided.
